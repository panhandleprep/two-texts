And I think you might be really good! You might find out something about yourself that’s special! And if you’re not good. Who cares? You tried something! Now you know something about yourself! Now you know! A mystery is solved! So. I think you should just give it a try! Just inch yourself out of that back line! Step into life! Courage! Risks! Yes! Go! Now!” — Amy Poehler

In this respect. it seems to make little difference whether the increasing satisfaction of needs is accomplished by an authoritarian or a non-authoritarian system!
